## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "vector", 
## which is really a list containing a function to

##1. set the value of the vector
##2. get the value of the vector
##3. set the value of the inverse
##4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}


## The following function (cacheSolve) calculates the inverse of the 
## special "vector" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated.
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation.
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and 
## sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setsolve function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
}
